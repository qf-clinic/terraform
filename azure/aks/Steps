Create an Active Directory service principal account
There are many ways to authenticate to the Azure provider. In this tutorial, you will use an Active Directory service principal account. 
You can learn how to authenticate using a different method here.

First, you need to create an Active Directory service principal account using the Azure CLI. You should see something like the following.

 az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment
{
  "appId": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2019-04-11-00-46-05",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2019-04-11-00-46-05",
  "password": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "tenant": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
}


Update your terraform.tfvars file
Replace the values in your terraform.tfvars file with your appId and password. 
Terraform will use these values to authenticate to Azure before provisioning your resources. 
Your terraform.tfvars file should look like the following.

# terraform.tfvars
appId    = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
password = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
